# Breakout Activity

## Note on feedback: C.A.S.K
Consensual, Actionable, Specific, Kind.   
Feedback is an important part of improving as a developer, but it’s important that we deliver it in a constructive way.

- C - Consensual: ask if you can give someone feedback
- A - Actionable: feedback should be actionable, avoid words like “good” or “bad”
- S - Specific: feedback needs to be specific, avoid generalizations. 
- K- Kind: don’t be a jerk.
