# What are we going to learn in ruby
- Learn the principles of Ruby as a language including principles of object oriented programming
- Discuss and practice the characteristics of a relational database
- Perform CRUD actions with a database using Active Record
- Design an API to handle CRUD actions
- Communicate with an API using different HTTP verbs
- Create and present a project with a React frontend and a database-backed API backend

# What is ruby
"A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write." https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

- Developer friendly, 'built for humans, not machines'
- Popularly used for Ruby on Rails
- Can be used as a procedural, functional or object-oriented language
- Everything in Ruby is an object!

# Companies that use ruby
- Shopify
- Groupon
- GitHub
- Netflix
- hulu
- airbnb

# What are we going to build
We are going to start with a CLI, to focus on the backend and review ruby fundamentals, OORuby, SQL and Active record. 

After the Code challenge

A full stack front-end and back-end up using Sinatra and React

# CLI vs GUI
CLI (Command Line Interface)
Accepts text inputs to execute scripts, programs and system functions
Still used by administrators for environment configuration

GUI (Graphical User Interface)

# Deliverables 
We've been hired by a small veterinary clinic to create a small CLI app they can use to track their patients.

This is a review of ruby fundamentals! To use rails you'll need to learn these concepts, just like you learned DOM manipulation before you learned React. As you ramp up progress very quickly and move from one concept and technology to the next. 



# Code along Directions:
1. cd into veterinary_clinic
2. In the terminal, run `bundle install`
2. In the terminal, run  `ruby ./bin/run.rb` to start the CLI
3. If the following error message is returned: zsh: permission denied: ./bin/run.rb, run the following command: `chmod +x ruby ./bin/run.rb`

# File structure 
- Gemfile (ruby gems)
- bin run.rb 
- lib cli.rb
