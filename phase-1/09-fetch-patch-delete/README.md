# CRUD with Fetch: PATCH & DELETE Requests

### Learning Goals

&emsp; âœ… Make PATCH and DELETE requests using values submitted through Click events

&emsp; âœ… PATCH and DELETE objects using .fetch()

&emsp; âœ… Render new data to the DOM

### Warm Up Question

&emsp; ðŸ’¡ How do PATCH and DELETE fetch request URLs differ those involving GET and POST? 

&emsp; ðŸ’¡ Why are these differences necessary when targeting individual database items?

### To use the mock-API:
- First install JSON Server: `npm install -g json-server`
- To start the server run: `json-server --watch db.json`
- This will produce the following endpoints: 
  - `http://localhost:3000/pokemons`
  - `http://localhost:3000/comments`
